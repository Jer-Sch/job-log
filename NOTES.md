Next steps (in no particular order):

1. Create helper methods in SessionsHelper (current_user, etc.)
2. Format page title? Favicon.
3. User model:
    a. flesh out validations (case sensitivity, valid email structure, etc.)
4. protect_from_forgery
5. Need to check for logged in users and correct users in controllers
6. Style (Bootstrap?)
7. Seed data
8. Logos
9. Telephone number formatting
10. Better addresses
11. Edit actions/forms
12. Order applications by date in applications index
13. Third-party authentication and fix for omniauth vulnerability

Get it working completely. Worry about styling last.
